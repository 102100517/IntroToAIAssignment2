#### Backwards Chaining 

Backwards chaining is an inference method where we work backwards from a goal. 

How it works: 

The engine starts with a list of consequents goals that it wants to meet. 
It then searches the list of inference rules until it finds one that satisfies 
one of its goals. 

If the inference rule BOTH satifies the goal AND its antecedent is known to be true, then 
the antecedent is added as a consequent. 
 


## Glossary 

Antecedent: first half of a logical statement. Follows directly after 'if'
			e.g: if <strong> it can fly </strong> then it is a bird 

Consequent: second half of a logical statement. Follows after 'then'. 
			e.g: if this subject sucks THEN <strong> I am bored </strong>
